# Follow-Me
Person recognition and following task for robot 

This project belongs to follow me task for AUT@Home team to participate in IranOpen2014. In this task robot should learn the person who is standing in front of her and follow the person.

We used Tracking Learning Detection method [a] and combine it with 3D information of person using Kinect sensor. We also used HaarCascade method to detect the person at the begnining of the task.

Our implementation is in c++ language based on ROS (Robotics Operation Systems) and we used also OpenCV and OpenNI tracker Library. Our team description paper is [b].
